# Example sources

`build.mjs` authors the operator-facing examples through OGraf Studio's MCP server. For each one it
saves the editable source here (`<slug>.ogs`) and exports the certified package to
`graphics/<slug>.ograf.zip`:

clock, countdown, scoreboard, lower-third, ticker, bug, rankings, live-markets, weather, weather-strap,
race-telemetry, shader-background and lottie-pulse.

`npm run graphics` copies each `.ogs` to `static/graphics`, and the player's caption links to it. The
prompt, model and generation time on each page live in `origin` in `src/data/examples.ts`. The time
is estimated from the session records and counts writing and building only. When you rebuild a
template from a new prompt, update its record.

The last two are built from `static/downloads/wave-bands.glsl` and `static/downloads/pulse.json`.

Rankings also has `rankings-votes.js`, the scoring function that Studio's Functions pane shows, and
`fonts/oswald.woff2` with its licence. Studio's canvas doesn't run functions, so `build.mjs` plays the
function up to the second jury's top score and uses the result as the default of the fields it
writes. That sample is what you see while designing. On air, the graphic starts from zero.

Live markets lives in `live-markets.mjs`, with its two functions in `live-markets-logic.js` and
`live-markets-crosshair.js`, and `fonts/inter.woff2` and `fonts/jetbrains-mono.woff2` with their licences.
`live-markets-snapshot.json` holds real prices, so the template has something to show before a feed
arrives. Refresh it with `node examples-src/live-markets-snapshot.mjs` before a rebuild. On the site the
data comes from `src/components/OGrafExample/marketFeed.ts`, and the markets and ranges both read are in
`src/data/marketData.mjs`. Three limits shaped it:

- Keep looping layers out of it. While any layer loops, the runtime redraws every layer on every frame,
  and with about 180 layers that starved the function workers until they failed. The dots beat when data
  arrives instead.
- A function takes at most 64 KiB of input, so `history` stays around 45 KB.
- A function runs in a new worker for each call, and all functions share one queue. A call that's already
  running can return after a click, so return only what the call changed, never an input as it came in.

Europe weather and the weather strap live in `weather.mjs`, with their functions in `weather-logic.js`
and `weather-strap-logic.js`, the rain, snow, thunder and fog shader in `weather-sky.glsl`, and
`fonts/oswald.woff2` and `fonts/inter.woff2`. The cities and the Open-Meteo request are in
`src/data/weatherData.mjs`, and on the site `src/components/OGrafExample/weatherFeed.ts` sends the
forecast to the graphic. A few things to know before changing them:

- `weather-snapshot.json` is a real forecast, so the templates show true weather before a feed
  arrives. Refresh it with `node examples-src/weather-snapshot.mjs` before a rebuild, because its first
  day becomes the date on screen.
- `weather-map.svg` is drawn from Natural Earth's 1:50m countries, which are public domain:
  `node examples-src/weather-map.mjs ne_50m_admin_0_countries.geojson`. The city spots in
  `weather-logic.js` and `weather-sky.glsl` come from the same script's `project(lon, lat)`. Change the
  projection and you must update both.
- Studio names a shader's fields after its layer, as `shader_layer_<id>_<name>`, and `weather.mjs`
  finds them that way. The Weather function packs each day's weather for six cities into one number,
  and `w_today`, `w_next` and `w_after` say how much of each day shows, so rules can cross-fade them.
- The icons are drawn in `weather-icons.mjs`, each moving inside its own picture. The functions only
  name the sky, and each icon layer's binding turns the name into its picture. Pictures in the
  function's output would pass the 64 KiB a function may return, with twelve cities on screen.
- The outlook's close-up is a picture, `weather-closeup.webp`: the map drawn 2.4 times larger by
  `node examples-src/weather-closeup.mjs`. A picture moves and zooms for nothing, while the map's own
  paths took about 30 ms a frame. Draw it again after changing the map. `CLOSE_UP` in `weather-map.mjs`
  says where it starts, and `weather-logic.js` keeps a copy.
- The map's three days are all on their layers at once, and the `view` field says which shows: the
  steps set it on arrival, and so do the day buttons' see-through `Day N hit` layers, but only while
  the map is up. Rules on `view` hide the other two days above or below their place, so a later day
  rolls up and an earlier one down. The steps between the days are one frame long, because rules do
  the change, not the timeline.
- A new outlook city is rules in `weather.mjs`: one rule to leave, which clears the weather and dips the
  numbers and the marker, one camera glide for each pair of cities, timed by how far apart they are and
  waiting `CLEAR` frames for the leave to finish, and one rule to land. A rule's move starts again from a
  standstill whenever anything else changes while it runs, another rule firing or new data, so nothing
  else happens while the camera moves. The Weather function waits out the glide (`CLEAR_MS` and
  `flightFrames`, in both files), then changes the numbers and counts the landing in `ui.landed`,
  which brings them back up. It reports the city the camera is on in `ui.shown`, for the glides to
  start from, and runs the tour on the same timer. Each rule that fires redraws the whole graphic once,
  so keep them few. Layers that rules move have no update transition, or an update fades them out
  before the new city even arrives.
- Text has a fixed size. Shrink-to-fit measures every label on every frame that something moves, which
  stalled a city change. Oswald's sizes are the ones shrink-to-fit used to settle on.
- Studio stores every key of every layer, so `weather.ogs` is about 6 MB. The package is about 2.7 MB.

Race telemetry replays the last lap of the 2020 Italian Grand Prix from public telemetry. It has no
feed and no function: the data is built in, as clips and rules. Three steps rebuild it:

```bash
node examples-src/race-telemetry-snapshot.mjs
```

```bash
node examples-src/race-telemetry-pictures.mjs
```

```bash
node examples-src/build.mjs race-telemetry
```

- `race-telemetry-snapshot.mjs` downloads the last two laps of every car still running from one fixed
  commit of [TracingInsights/2020](https://github.com/TracingInsights/2020) (MIT) and the official
  result from [TracingInsights/RaceData](https://github.com/TracingInsights/RaceData) (CC0), and saves
  what the example needs in `race-telemetry-snapshot.json`. `race-telemetry-data.mjs` reads it.
- `race-telemetry-story.mjs` works out what happened: the gap between the two leaders, the running
  order, the tower, the captions, and every piece of text that changes with the moment it does.
- `race-telemetry-art.mjs` holds the layout and draws everything that never changes as pages:
  the backdrop with the circuit and every fixed label, the charts, the car markers, the strips of
  digits, the winner's card and the result. `race-telemetry-pictures.mjs` saves them as WebP in
  `race-telemetry-pictures`, with a headless Chrome.
- `race-telemetry.mjs` places the layers, gives the moving ones their clips and writes the rules.

A few things to know before changing it:

- The runtime works on every layer on every frame, moving or not. The first version had 126 layers
  and used 40% of a processor core; with the fixed parts as pictures it has 73 and uses 27%. A
  drawn picture is also only copied when a car passes over it, where a vector one is drawn again.
  So add to the backdrop before you add a layer.
- The runtime also looks through every key of every track on each frame. A number that changes ten
  times a second costs about 2,000 keys a lap, so the gap changes five times a second.
- The lap is clips, not a step, because Stop waits for a running step and this one would last 103
  seconds. The clips start when the graphic is on air (`lifecycle`) and play once. A clip started by
  a custom action would go back to its layer's resting pose at the end, and an operator's custom
  action also holds every other command up until its clip has finished.
- There is no function. One wrote the numbers ten times a second at first. Each call needs a new
  worker, and on a busy machine one now and then failed to start in time. A function that fails
  once stays failed, so the numbers froze while the cars drove on, in most laps of one test. Now
  the fast numbers are strips of digits on clips, and the rest is set by rules.
- A rolling number is a window (`clipChildren`) with a strip for each digit inside it: a blank, then
  0 to 9. The clip moves the strip so one cell shows. Cells touch, so a digit seen mid-change is two
  half digits and not a blank.
- The rules hang on a hidden timer, the race clock, which a `play` rule restarts when the graphic has
  arrived on air: the same moment the clips start. Each of its alarms sets the fields that change
  then. A `stop` rule, delayed until the graphic has gone, puts every field and both timers back,
  so a second Play opens at the first moment again.
- The lap clock is a timer too. Its starting value is bound to `clock_from`, and the alarm at the
  line sets that to zero, which sends a running timer back to zero.
- A cover has to be solid whenever what it hides can be seen, or the hidden part shows through the
  fades. The charts' covers and the rev rings' centres come up first and go down last (`COVERS` and
  `COVERED` in `race-telemetry.mjs`).
- A clip can't move a wipe (`clipRight` and the others), so the charts are drawn by sliding a cover
  off them, and their guides are a picture laid over the cover.
- The gap is measured from the two cars' positions and nudged to the official gap at each timing
  line. The tower shows only official gaps, which change as each car crosses a line.
- The telemetry ends at the flag. After it a car coasts on round the outline, which is made up, and
  its gauges hold what they read at the line.
- A percent sign in an SVG data URI breaks the export with "URI malformed" unless it is escaped,
  and a repeated attribute makes the picture invalid, which Studio waits on until capture times out.
- `RACE_FROM=80 node examples-src/build.mjs race-telemetry` starts the replay 80 seconds into the lap,
  to look at a moment without waiting for it. Don't ship that build.
- To replay another race, change `SOURCE` and `LAPS` in the snapshot script and the two cars in the
  story, then check the map's rotation and the corner names in the art.

## Fonts

Studio's recipes embed a 371 KB TrueType copy of Roboto Condensed unless the template already has the
family, so `build.mjs` gives those templates `fonts/roboto-condensed.woff2` first. Both fonts here are
the upstream variable fonts as WOFF2 without hinting, which their scaled text doesn't use. Every character
and weight is still there, because visitors type into these forms and broadcasters download them:

```bash
pyftsubset font.ttf --unicodes='*' --layout-features='*' --no-hinting --name-IDs='*' --name-languages='*' --notdef-outline --flavor=woff2
```

## What each one needs from Studio

These sources use settings driven by data on clocks and timers (`clock.timeZone`, `clock.format` and
others) and native ticker bindings. Open or rebuild them with a Studio that has those features.

## Rebuild

Run a separate copy of Studio, so the script never touches an editor you're working in. From a Studio
checkout:

```bash
OGRAF_MCP_PORT=4398 OGRAF_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/path/to/ografstudio-site npm run mcp:start
```

```bash
VITE_OGRAF_AGENT_BRIDGE_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:4398/editor npm run dev --workspace apps/editor -- --port 5190 --strictPort
```

Open Studio on port 5190 and keep its tab visible, because certification plays each graphic in real
time. Then, from this site:

```bash
node examples-src/build.mjs
```

```bash
npm run graphics
```

Pass slugs to rebuild only some: `node examples-src/build.mjs clock bug`.

The MCP server loads the OGraf runtime when it starts. After changing the runtime in Studio, restart
both servers before exporting, or the packages keep the old one.

## Controls on the site

The form in `src/components/OGrafExample` is built from each package's manifest:

- Field titles, descriptions and dropdown labels come from the data fields in `build.mjs`.
- Each custom action becomes a button. An action with the id `add:<field>:<step>` also moves the
  form's copy of that field, because the graphic changes the field itself.
- A package with more than one step gets a Next button.
